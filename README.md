# 🤖 Discord Joke Bot  

Welcome to **Discord Joke Bot**, the bot nobody asked for but everyone needed! 🎉  

This is a fun side project I started to spice up my friends' Discord server with some good ol’ humor, banter, and random hilarity. Whether you're into dad jokes, meme references, or want to see some adorable cat pictures, Joke Bot's got you covered!

## ✨ Features  

### 🔑 Trigger-based Replies  
It’s simple: you say something, and the bot replies with a preloaded zinger! For example:  
- **apples**: "Well I got her number, how\'d you like them apples"

Trigger keys = fun. Values = epic comebacks. It's the circle of Discord life.  

### 🐱 Meow-velous Cats 
Check out [**The Cat API**](https://thecatapi.com/) that I used.

### 🃏 Jokes Galore
